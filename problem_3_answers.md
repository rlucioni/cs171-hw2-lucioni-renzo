**NOTE:** My work from Design Studio 1 can be found in [`design-studio-1-solutions.pdf`](design-studio-solutions.pdf).

1. Referring to the Lee et al. reading, I think that an ideal GitHub Network Graph needs to address the following graph-related tasks, ranked in order of importance:
    - Scan: to allow a user, most likely a project contributor, to quickly review a list of commits
    - Follow Path: to trace the history of a series of commits
    - Revisit: to return to the commit at the end of an explored path, in order to follow other paths branching from this node, if they exist
    - Filter: to find commits that meet a certain set of search parameters, such as a date range
    - Sort: to order commits by metadata characteristics, such as additions or deletions, net commit size, or date authored

    In short, I think that an ideal GitHub Network Graph needs to prioritize Browsing and Overview tasks.
